\section{Summary}

\textbf{Core competencies}: React, Node, TypeScript, AWS Serverless stack, Agile best practices and engineering excellence (TDD, CI/CD, XP practices), functional programming (Haskell)\\

I am a highly experienced software engineer who has worked on a range of different domains, problems, and technologies. My main focus throughout my career has been on excellence and best practices - both cultural and engineering.\\

This is evidenced by my previous and current roles, where I have promoted and encouraged well-tested, clean code through a combination of fast-feedback loops, TDD, best practices such as pair programming, and creating a safe working environment. Through this focus, I have been instrumental in shaping and forming positive team culture and engineering best practices, whilst taking lead on green-field projects critical to achieving business and organisational goals\\

In my current role, I have been instrumental in shaping and forming positive team culture and engineering best practices, whilst taking lead on green-field projects critical to achieving business and organizational goals.\\

My ambition is to help shape agile teams, to enable them to innovate and move quickly. I believe this is best achieved through building autonomous teams, deeply routed in extreme programming best practices, with emphasis on automation through CI/CD, pair programming involving all relevant disciplines, coupled with expert knowledge of the technologies involved.\\

I bring extremely strong technical abilities, ranging from cloud, web, mobile, and the full software-engineering stack - from strongly-typed functional programming languages (such as Haskell and TypeScript) to web-standards and design. I have had considerable influence on large-scale production applications and pride myself on the end-result achieved.\\

All in all, I view software as a team enterprise and I am a believer in the value of the principles of extreme programming. This involves a strong emphasis on pair/mob programming and including all disciplines in the software-creation process as early as possible, coupled with expert knowledge of the technologies involved.\\
