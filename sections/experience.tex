\textbf{02/2021 - present \hspace{2.75em}Staff Engineer, AND Digital}\\

As a Staff Engineer I have been working closely with stakeholders and other engineers, bridging the gap between client and AND, ensuring successful delivery and execution of client requirements. I am completely focused on delivery user value and helping organisations accelerate their digital ambitions.\\

Over my time at AND I have helped lead three projects to successfully meet deliverables and deliver value. Iâ€™ve worked closely with client stakeholders, AND delivery leads, and other developers to ensure work is completed as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Off client, I have contributed to the culture of the developer community, mentored other developers (formally and through more ad-hoc relationships), and acted as a positive senior role model.\\

I have worn many hats at AND, showing flexibility and pragmatism, with a focus on enabling each team to deliver to the best of their abilities, all whilst being pivotal in helping develop the culture and best practices across the whole of the Jemison AND club. I have focused on engineering and agile best practices and see my self as a cross-cutting generalist who helps organisations and teams deliver value at pace.\\

My roles:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Very Group   - Staff Software Engineer
  \item Princes' Trust   - Senior Software Engineer
  \item Internal Project - Lead Software Engineer
  \item Boohoo           - Led workshops
\end{itemize}

On my current client engagement at The Very Group I have helped lead 2 teams to the successful delivery of Phase 1 work. I have helped design and implement an AWS event-driven, serverless architecture, that serves as a piece of critical infrastructure that consumes and produces financial events. This work has allowed The Very Group to migrate from a previous service provider, allowing the business to offer better services to customers. I also was instrumental in designing and implementing the automation test strategy (E2E and integration tests), have mentored junior developers, and practiced and preached test-driven design and continuous integration.\\
